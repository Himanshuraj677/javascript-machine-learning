# Machine Learning Projects with JavaScript

This repo is made of 3 projects:

1. [**Plinko**](#plinko): A quick introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Lodash.
2. [**House Pricings**](#housepricings): Another implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with Tensorflow.js.
3. [**Gas Mileage Calculator**](#gasmileage): A gradient descent algorithm using Tensorflow.js.
